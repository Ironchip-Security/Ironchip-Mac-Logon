## Logon

### What it is
Logon is a custom Windows credential provider by [Ironchip](https://www.ironchip.com/) that integrates Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) directly into the Windows login experience.

**Cached Passwords:**
Our simplified access can enhance user experience, making it more convenient and user-friendly. This is especially valuable in a work or personal environment where you're required to log in to various systems multiple times a day.

**Extra Layer:**
MFA adds an extra layer of protection, requiring multiple forms of authentication, such as a password and a one-time code or push notification. 

**Improved Compliance:**
MFA helps organizations meet compliance requirements and security standards by implementing robust authentication methods.
